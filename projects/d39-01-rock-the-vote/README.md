# Rock the Vote with DB

You are going to create a website that allows users to post and upvote or downvote political issues.

Requirements:
* Web page that shows a list of political issues
    * Each item will have a title
    * Each item will have a description
    * Each item can be upvoted or downvoted
    * Items will be ordered by upvotes (the most being at the top).
    * Each item should show the total number of votes 
* Web page will have a Post button that allows new posts
* Users can comment on posts (unlimited number of comments per post)
* Use React for the front-end
* Use Node/Express for the back-end
* Clearly you will need the ability to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* Create all needed Mongoose Schemas to be used in tandem with a Mongo database

Spend the necessary time to make this a portfolio piece project.
