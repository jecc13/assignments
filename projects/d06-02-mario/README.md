# Mario Pest Control

Princess Peach has a huge infestation of Goombas, Bob-ombs, and Cheep-cheeps, and has commissioned Mario to take care of her pest problem. Mario did the job, but he is having trouble keep track of how many he has caught and has asked you to build him a website that keeps track of how many baddies he caught for Princess Peach so he can send her a bill.
