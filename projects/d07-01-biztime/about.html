                Environmentally Ethical Pesticides are one of the biggest causes of the decline of the bee in the United States. We make
                sure to minimize impact on non-target pests through integrated pest management on every home we treat. DSC_1198.jpg
                PROTECTING THE BEE Bug bully will NOT treat directly onto flowers or flowering plants. A bee flying from
                garden to garden will spread these residual pesticides causing harm to none target pests. DSC_1196.jpg PROTECTING
                OUR FOOD We do not treat your garden with the same treatments we treat your home with. Your garden is protected
                by Mother Earth treatments, that are food safe, and good for soil too. DSC_0512.jpg PROTECTING OUR WATER
                Bug Bully will not treat directly into or connected to water sources such as ponds, rivers, or water features.
                We all drink and use water. Lets keep pesticides out.Â¸
