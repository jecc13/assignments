# Ditto's Playground

You will re-create the following home page of the following website:

http://www.csszengarden.com/

Links and JavaScript functionality do not have to work.

Fonts, images, etc can be found in the sources tab. You can also use this awesome Chrome extension called What Font, which lets you hover over HTML elements and see their text styling/fonts/sizes, etc.

Write your HTML and CSS from scratch. Do not copy and paste from Chrome dev tools.

This project is expected to take 20+ hours for many people. It's difficult. Please don't get stuck on any one aspect for too long. Ask your class mates how they approached different problems.
