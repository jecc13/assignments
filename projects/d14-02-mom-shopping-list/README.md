# Mom's Shopping List

Your mom is frustrated by her propensity to lose slips of paper with writing on them, specifically her shopping lists. She knows that you're a really smart web developer and assumes that you can easily make her a website to keep track of her shopping list.

## Project Requirements
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and optionally jQuery), write a simple shopping list app. There must be an input box to add new items, and an [x] button to delete items. The data does not have to persist a page refresh (because there's no API right now).

You should be able to delete items by clicking the [x]. 

## Passing criteria: Demo to an instructor or TA
An instructor or TA will sit with you for a demonstration of this project. They will be assessing your proficiency in the following areas:
* Difference between web app and web site
* Build very basic web apps (site is functional and based on user interaction)
* Understand JSON

Passing off this project completes the Web Applications, Level 1 branch of the skills tree.

Extra Credit
* Use localStorage or sessionStorage to save the list in case the page is refreshed.
