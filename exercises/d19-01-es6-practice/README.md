# ES6 Practice - Let, Const, Fat Arrow Functions, Default Arguments, Template Literals

## Let and Var


Use let and const and try to use these new features

Replace all the `var`s with `let` and `const`

John is the pet owner, and his name should be stored differently than the other names.

``` 
var name = 'John'  
var age = 101  
var pets = ["cat", "dog"]

var petObjects = []

for (var i = 0; i < pets.length; i++){  
  var pet = {type: pets[i]}
  if (pets[i] === "cat"){
    var name = "fluffy"
  } else {
    var name = "spot"
  }
  pet.name = name
  petObjects.push(pet)
} 
```

# ES6 Functions

Fat arrow functions.

re-write this `.map()` using a fat arrow function:

Be aware that if JavaScript sees a { directly after the => it will think it's starting a function, and not starting an object so the : will be an unexpected symbol.

``` 
const vegetables = carrots.map(function(carrot){  
    return {type: "carrot", name: carrot}
}) 
```

re-write this `.filter()` using a fat arrow function:

``` 
friends = people.filter(function(person){  
    return !!person.friendly
}) 
```


re-write the following functions to be fat arrow functions:

``` 
function doMathSum(a, b){  
    return a + b
}

var produceProduct = function(a, b){  
    return a * b
} 
```

write a functions that takes a firstName, a lastName, an age and returns a string like the following:

`Hi Kat Stark, how does it feel to be 40? `

firstName should default to `"Jane"` 
lastName should default to `"Doe"` 
age should default to `100`

Use the shorthand syntax to make the following code block take up one line.

``` 
const dogs = animals.filter((animal)=>{  
  if (animal.type === "dog"){
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
})  
```

## Template Literals


Write a function that will take `location` and `name` and output this if `location="Hawaii"` and `name="Janice"`:

``` 
Hi Janice!

Welcome to Hawaii. 

I hope you enjoy your stay. Please ask the president of Hawaii if you need anything.
``` 

If you didn't do that with Template Literals, do it now with Template Literals.
