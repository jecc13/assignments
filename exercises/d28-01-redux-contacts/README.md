# Redux Contacts (Pure JS Redux)

Build a contact management system using Redux in a vanilla JavaScript environment (no React).

You should be able to dispatch actions that add a new person and remove an existing person from an array of contacts.

The contact objects can have whatever properties you want. For example:
```
{
    name: "Tommy Oliver",
    phone: "925-867-5309",
    email: "thegreenranger@powerrangers.com"
}
```
