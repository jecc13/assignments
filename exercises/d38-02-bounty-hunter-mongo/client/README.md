#Bounty Hunter Client

The front-end of the Bounty Hunter app. 

From the instructions for all 3 parts... 
"Your front-end React app should be a CRUD application - it should be able to Create (POST) new bounties, Read (GET) existing bounties and show them to the user of your site, Update (PUT) existing bounties (like if you wanted to up the price for a bounty, e.g.), and Delete (DELETE) bounties from the list of all bounties."
