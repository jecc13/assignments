# First HTTP Request with Node

In this example you will be able to use node to make you first http request right in the terminal/console. While node does have a built-in module called http for performing http requests, it's notoriously more complicated than it needs to be. Most developers opt for an npm package called request to perform HTTP requests in node.

# Note
The exercise on the syllabus was called Postman Practice, which we did in class IN the Postman app. There was nothing to submit to github. Since the HTTP Request with Node did have a JS file, I'm submitting that under "postman practice".
