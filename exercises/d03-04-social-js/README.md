# Social.js

Create a model to represent the database of a new social media platform you're creating. It can be about whatever you want, but it needs the following:

* At least 3 nested levels of data (including objects and arrays)
* At least 1 method
* Span across at least 50 lines of code. (No empty lines)

After you create the base object, you need to:

1. Add 2 properties to one of the objects (doesn't matter what level of nested data you do this to)
2. Add 2 items to at least one of the arrays in your data
