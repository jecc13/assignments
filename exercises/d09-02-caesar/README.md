# Caesar Cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet." -Wikipedia

For this exercise, you will be implementing a Caeser cipher using Javascript. Your program will receive two inputs:

* The text to be encoded
* The number positions to shift each letter (to the right)

You only have to shift letters that are part of the 26-letter alphabet. Any other characters (such as spaces) should be printed as they were received. The shift value will always be on the interval [0, 26].
