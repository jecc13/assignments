# Chuck Norris Joke Generator

For this exercise you will make a simple React app which will display a Chuck Norris joke when the user clicks a button.

Requirements
1) Jokes will be generated by making HTTP GET requests to the [Chuck Norris API](http://www.icndb.com/api/). 
2) You must use `redux`, `thunk`, and `axios`. 
3) Your app must be responsive and styled creatively.
