Rest and Spread Operator

Use the Rest Operator to help this function return an array of animals, no matter how many animals are passed to it:

```
function collectAnimals() {  

}

collectAnimals("dog", "cat", "mouse", "jackolope", "platypus");  
// ["dog", "cat", "mouse", "jackolope", "platypus"]
```

Make a food object with the array names as properties using Object Literals:

```
const fruit = ["apple", "pear"];  
const sweets = ["cake", "pie"];  
const vegetables = ["carrit"];

const food = {.....}  
```

Use destructuring to fill in the blanks and use the property names as variables:

```
const vacation = {  
  location: "Burly Idaho",
  duration: "2 weeks"
};

//your code

console.log(`We're going to have a good time in ${location} for ${duration}`)  
```

Use destructuring to make this code ES6:
```
const firstItem = items[0];  
Use destructuring to make this code ES6:

const firstItem = items[0];  
```

Write destructuring code to assign variables that will help us print the expected string. Also, change the string to be using Template literals:
```
const favoriteActivitiesInOrder = ["magnets", "snowboarding", "philanthropy", "janitor work", "eating"];

// your code

console.log("My top three favorite activities are, " + firstFav + ", " + secondFav + ", and " + thirdFav");  
```

Use the Rest and Spread Operator to help take any number of arrays, and return one array. You will need to change how the arrays are passed in.

```
function combineAnimals() {  

}

const realAnimals = ["dog", "cat", "mouse"];  
const magicalAnimals = ["jackolope"];  
const mysteriousAnimals = ["platypus"];

combineAnimals(realAnimals, magicalAnimals, mysteriousAnimals); 

// ["dog", "cat", "mouse", "jackolope", "platypus"]
```

Try to make the following function more ES6xy:
```
function product(a, b, c, d, e) {  
  var numbers = [a,b,c,d,e];

  return numbers.reduce(function(acc, number) {
    return acc * number;
  }, 1)
}
```

Make the following function more ES6xy. Use at least both the rest and spread operators:
```
function unshift(array, a, b, c, d, e) {  
  return [a, b, c, d, e].concat(array);
}
```
Write some destructuring code to help this function out. Use object literals to simplify it:
```
function populatePeople(names){  
    return names.map(function(name){
        name = name.split(" ");
        // your code
        return {
            firstName: firstName,
            lastName: lastName
        }
}

populatePeople(["Frank Peterson", "Suzy Degual", "Liza Jones"])  
//[
//  {firstName: "Frank", lastName: "Peterson"},
//  {firstName: "Suzy", lastName: "Degual"},
//  {firstName: "Liza", lastName: "Jones"},
//]
```
