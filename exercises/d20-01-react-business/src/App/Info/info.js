                <p>Our Pest Protection Plan is ever evolving, from the changes in the seasons to the needs of a certain home. When
                    the Goombas started taking over Utah homes, we invested in the Growth Regulators to tackle this specific
                    pest. Free of charge to our protected customers. We keep in constant contact with the Department of Agriculture
                    in order to see new pesticide approvals, and developments in treatments for target pests. Our Pest Protection
                    Plan covers target pests such as Goombas, Bob-ombs, Cheep-cheeps, and hundreds more. </p>
                <p>We understand the state of the Bee, and through our Integrated Pest Management system, we reduce the environmental impact of pest treatments.</p>
