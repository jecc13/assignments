            <p>Pesticides are one of the biggest causes of the decline of the bee in the United States. We make
                sure to minimize impact on non-target pests through integrated pest management on every home we treat.</p>

                PROTECTING THE BEE - We will NOT treat directly onto flowers or flowering plants. A bee flying from garden to garden will spread these residual pesticides causing harm to none target pests.</p>

                PROTECTING OUR FOOD - We do not treat your garden with the same treatments we treat your home with. Your garden is protected by Mother Earth treatments, that are food safe, and good for soil too.</p>

                PROTECTING OUR WATER - We will not treat directly into or connected to water sources such as ponds, rivers,
                or water features. We all drink and use water. Lets keep pesticides out.</p>
