# Mouse Debug

## Setup
https://github.com/VSchool/mouse-debug

You will need to clone the above repo from Github. Go to your exercises folder and enter the following command.

`git clone https://github.com/VSchool/mouse-debug`

This clone will have a `.git` folder. You don't want that.

cd into `mouse-debug` and `rm -rf .git`.


## Goal
The goal of this debugging practice is to max "x" and "y" out at 300.

You can see that neither will go below 100, but when we try to use the same logic to keep them below 300, it does not work.

Use your dev tools to see what's going on.
