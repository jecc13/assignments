# React Wars

Your goal will be to build a simple Single Page Application that implements React Router with axios.

1) Create a sidebar of Link components displaying the character names retrieved from the star wars api.

Use this URL: https://swapi.co/api/people/

2) Using a Switch component, display each character's physical characteristics on a separate view for each link. You'll have to make a new request to the endpoint specified in the "url" property of each character to display that character's info.

For example, to retrieve Luke Skywalker's info: 
https://swapi.co/api/people/1
